Ever stood in front of a cube puzzle in Inazuma and thought to yourself: _I don't want to waste a [burst](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/op2p64/the_biggest_brain_in_inazuma/) [on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh8xvINAdqs)_

Then you've come to the right place! [Head over to the website and hunt down your puzzle](https://mgatelabs.github.io/GenshinSolvers/). Enter the initial configuration and follow the solution steps.

## Developer instructions

Clone the repository, the `Pages` branch is where the Angular code for the website is.

Then run

```
npm install
```

And finally, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
